# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
-  Using R to analyze a series of datasets from the MechaCar. Refer to [MechaCarChallenge.R](../main/MechaCarChallenge.R)

## Challenge
- Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- T-Test on Suspension Coils
- Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

## Summary 
- Linear Regression to Predict MPG: The vehicle.length, ground.clearance and intercept are the variables and the P-value (2.277e-11) is less than assumed significance level (0.05). Refer to test result below:![alt text](../main/ScreenShot_Deliverable1.png)
